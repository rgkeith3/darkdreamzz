ok, changed plans.

it's 3d now.
  maybe I could eventually reforctor it to make it cleaner

  make the stars float around and be their own objects that,
  when intersecting with a raycaster, plays a note.

  those notes are played alonga drone note.

  maybe have at random intervals, play some samples of people speaking sexily
  and also at random intervals, curry up a poem by picking words from the library:

  [THE or A][Something][verbs][In, on, at][The or a][thing]


need to add sounds to main page, and links
need to make about page
  about page could be some words infront of a red glass rose
  when you click on the rose, more words come up
